# thisIsUtkarsh

This is my first attempt in building my portfolio website. I have used HTML5, CSS and javascript and created a standalone webpage with some intuitive design ideas.

Some elements in the page change behaviour with the viewer's screen size so I suggest visiting the page on different devices to see all effects.

I am an amateur and this my first attempt and I am sure there will be a ton of aspects which can be improved so I openly accept all the suggestions and critics.
